# Apostasy
This project is focused on building a (simpler) interpreter for simple Ren'py-based games.

It is mainly being used for learning, however an end goal would be for this tool to begin acting as a means to porting a Ren'py-based Visual Novel / game / etc. to the NovelRT engine.
(It's meant for the apostatizing of games away from the current Visual Novel Engine standard. ;] )

## Building Instructions

### Prerequisites

You will need:

- .NET SDK 5.0 or higher
(This assumes you have a matching runtime installed as well.)

### Building

To build, simply open your favorite .NET IDE that's compatible with .NET 5 or higher, open the `Apostasy.sln` file, and build!
Apostasy will compile as a library - there is a sample application that shows its current usage in the interim.
